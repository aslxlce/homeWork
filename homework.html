                    JavaScript is a powerful and widely-used programming language designed to make
                    web pages dynamic and interactive. It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while
                    he was working at Netscape Communications. Over the years, JavaScript has
                    evolved into a critical component of the modern web.

                <h1>What Does JavaScript Do?</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Add Interactivity: Allows users to engage with web pages through animations,
                        buttons, form validations, and more.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create Dynamic Content: Updates webpage elements in real-time without
                        needing to reload (e.g., live chat, search suggestions).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Power Web Applications: Enables modern apps like Gmail, Google Maps, and
                        social media platforms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Handle Backend Operations: With Node.js, JavaScript can now run server-side
                        code, making it a full-stack programming language.
                    </li>

                <h1>Why is JavaScript Important?</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Core Web Technology: JavaScript, alongside HTML and CSS, forms the
                        foundation of web development.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ubiquitous: It runs in every major browser without the need for additional
                        plugins.
                    </li>
                    <li>Versatile: JavaScript supports both front-end and back-end development.</li>
                    <li>
                        Ecosystem: A vast array of libraries and frameworks (e.g., React, Angular,
                        Vue.js) make development faster and easier.
